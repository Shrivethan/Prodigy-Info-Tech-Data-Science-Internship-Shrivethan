Prodigy Infotech Internship - Data Science Project
Overview
This README file provides an overview of the tasks completed during the data science internship at Prodigy Infotech. The internship involved various data analysis and machine learning tasks aimed at gaining insights from data and building predictive models. Below are the detailed descriptions of each task.

Task 1: Create a Bar Chart or Histogram
Objective
To visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

Description
Dataset: A sample dataset containing demographic information (e.g., age, gender).
Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Steps:
Load the dataset using Pandas.
Clean and preprocess the data if necessary.
Create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical variable (e.g., gender).
Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable (e.g., age).
Customize the plots with titles, labels, and legends for better readability.
Results
The bar chart and histogram provided clear visual representations of the demographic distributions, allowing for easy interpretation of the data.

Task 2: Perform Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective
To clean the data and perform exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.

Description
Dataset: A raw dataset with potential missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Steps:
Load the dataset using Pandas.
Identify and handle missing values.
Detect and address outliers.
Perform data transformation and normalization if needed.
Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand data distributions, relationships, and key statistics.
Visualize the data using various plots (e.g., scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps).
Results
The data cleaning and EDA processes helped in transforming the raw data into a structured format and uncovering valuable insights, which are essential for building robust models.

Task 3: Build a Decision Tree Classifier
Objective
To predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

Description
Dataset: Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
Steps:
Load the dataset and preprocess it (handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Build a decision tree classifier using Scikit-learn.
Train the model on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize the decision tree.
Results
The decision tree classifier effectively predicted customer purchase behavior, providing insights into the key factors influencing purchase decisions.

Task 4: Analyze and Visualize Sentiment Patterns in Social Media Data
Objective
To understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands by analyzing sentiment patterns in social media data.

Description
Dataset: Social media data (e.g., tweets, posts) containing text related to specific topics or brands.
Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NLTK, TextBlob, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Steps:
Collect social media data using APIs or from pre-existing datasets.
Clean and preprocess the text data (remove stop words, perform tokenization, etc.).
Perform sentiment analysis using libraries like TextBlob or NLTK.
Visualize sentiment patterns using bar charts, word clouds, and time series plots.
Interpret the results to understand public sentiment and opinion trends.
Results
The sentiment analysis provided insights into public opinion and attitudes towards the analyzed topics or brands, highlighting positive, negative, and neutral sentiments over time.

Conclusion
The tasks completed during this internship provided hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning, and sentiment analysis. The skills and knowledge gained through these tasks are invaluable for a career in data science.
